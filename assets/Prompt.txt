Input: Title: France’s Rating Looks Shaky After Year of S&P Negative View

Text: A year after President Emmanuel Macron
received a warning that France’s credit status faced closer
scrutiny, the possibility of a humbling downgrade is looming
ever larger.
With debt stuck around 110% of gross domestic product, the
criteria S&P Global Ratings specified to keep its AA assessment
are being tested. It has scheduled an update on Friday, almost
exactly 12 months after announcing a negative outlook.
Data on the eve of that showed French output unexpectedly
shrank in the third quarter, and a downgrade could inflict a
further body blow to the presidency of Macron, who has held to
commitments for economic reform and fiscal rectitude since
taking office in 2017.
That approach initially convinced sovereign analysts —
until unprecedented spending during the pandemic and the energy
crisis left France with bloated public finances.
So now, more than a decade after S&P was first to lower its
top assessment in the wake of the euro-region’s debt turmoil,
France’s status as a borrower is once again in question. A cut
would follow in the footsteps of Fitch Ratings, which downgraded
one notch lower to AA- in April.
“France is a weak AA rating, no doubt,” said Axel Botte,
head of market strategy at Ostrum Asset Management. He sees
single A as a “likely” outcome over the medium term.
Any change would give investors more fuel to re-evaluate
Europe’s fiscal landscape, as they reward Ireland, Portugal and
Greece for cutting debt at a time when France has dragged its
feet.
Economists expect little fiscal consolidation next year,
and the government only intends to bring the budget gap within
the European Union’s newly-reinstated 3%-of-output limit by
2027.
Much of that plan relies on a forecast for an acceleration
in economic growth, but the latest indicators show the country
may instead be losing momentum. Consumer spending dropped in
October and November survey data confirmed on Friday that
manufacturing activity suffered a 10th consecutive month of
contraction. 
The concern is that France’s debt pile — 20 percentage
points higher than the bloc’s 90% average — exposes it to
interest rates that have markedly risen. The French 10-year bond
yield, which traded below 0% less than two years ago, has soared
past 3%.
According to finance ministry forecasts, the public-debt
ratio will be stable through 2025, as the deficit narrows only
gradually. 
That may look challenging against the timetable of S&P,
whose negative outlooks for investment-grade borrowers tend to
focus on a two-year horizon. 
It said in June that “we could lower our sovereign ratings
on France within the next 18 months if general government debt
as a share of GDP does not steadily decline over 2023-2025.” 
Ministry officials anticipate the costs of servicing those
borrowings will nearly double to €74 billion ($81 billion) by
2027. 
The gap between the 10-year French yield and the German
benchmark has widened to about 60 basis over the past year, a
contrast to the equivalent Italian spread which has narrowed.
Spain’s spread over Germany has been stable over that period.
“Overall debt is seen as a longer term risk on France, and
you need a premium for this,” said Olivier De Larouziere, chief
investment officer for global fixed income at BNP Paribas Asset
Management. “I think this is exactly why the spread has
widened.”
The rating danger has put Macron’s team on the defensive.
Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has said there’s no reason to
doubt his or France’s credibility, and warned that a downgrade
would only amplify the country’s challenges by pushing borrowing
costs up further. 
“Everything is possible, it’s up to them,” he said Thursday
in a broadcast interview. “But I think we have provided solid
arguments on our determination to cut debt.”
The euro area’s second-biggest economy does remain safely
in investment-grade territory. Moody’s Investors Service, whose
rating of France is comparable to S&P’s, has kept its outlook
stable. It assesses Italy far lower, just one notch above junk.
Moreover, refinancing risk will only emerge if rates remain
high for “a very long time,” De Larouziere said. Good liquidity
also underpins the appeal of its bonds, he added. 
In September, France presented a first step toward tackling
high debt with €16 billion of savings to reduce deficit to 4.4%
of economic output in 2024 from 4.9% this year. But most of that
will come from withdrawing vast support provided to households
and firms during the energy crisis.
Those fiscal plans face closer scrutiny after the EU said
last month that France is at risk of breaching recommendations
on spending growth next year.

Input: Title: Japan Capex Spending Rise May Help Temper Economy’s Contraction

Text: Japan’s businesses increased investment
modestly over the summer as profits continued to grow in a sign
of resilience even as the economy shrank.
Capital expenditures on goods excluding software rose 0.3%
in the three months through September compared with the previous
quarter, the finance ministry reported on Friday. The data will
be factored into revised gross domestic product figures for the
period. The initial reading showed the economy shrank at an
annualized pace of 2.1%.
The latest capex figures were more encouraging than similar
figures in the third-quarter GDP statistics, which showed
business investment slipping 0.6% quarter on quarter. The second
GDP reading is due on Dec. 8. The finance ministry data also
showed that company profits rose 20.1% in the quarter compared
with a year earlier, well ahead of consensus estimates. 
The capex and profit figures may serve as an encouraging
sign for the Bank of Japan, as the results show that companies
likely have leeway to continue with strong wage hikes.
Authorities are watching for signs corporations are willing to
channel more profits into the pockets of workers, a development
that might allow the BOJ to ease up on policy stimulus.
Still, Friday’s statistics weren’t as robust as forecasts
in the BOJ’s Tankan survey showing large companies were planning
to increase spending this fiscal year by 13.6%.
“The BOJ’s Tankan shows strong capital investment plans,
but they haven’t fully materialized yet,” said Takeshi Minami,
economist at Norinchukin Research Institute. “Companies are
cautious given their concerns over overseas economies.”
Separately, labor ministry data showed the job market
strengthened in October in another mildly positive sign for the
central bank. The unemployment rate inched lower to 2.5%, the
lowest since June. The jobs-to-applicant ratio edged up to 1.30,
meaning there were 130 jobs offered for every 100 applicants.
Together with the capital spending figures, the data
suggest companies may not have been quite as gloomy about their
prospects over the summer as previously thought. Even so,
economists are still concerned about the strength of Japan’s
sputtering economy and whether it can gain sufficient momentum
to enable the BOJ to pare back stimulus. 
Some analysts still warn that GDP could contract again in
the current quarter, putting the economy in a technical
recession as overseas economies slow and consumer spending
remains weak in the face of inflation.

What Bloomberg Economics Says...

“Japan’s October jobs data suggest hiring demand is slowly
gaining vigor — and that’s likely to be encouraging for the Bank
of Japan, which wants brisk wage growth to push prices higher.”
— Taro Kimura, economist

The investment data showed a return to growth in the
service sector on the back of surging consumption by inbound
tourists. The number of foreign visitors to Japan has grown
sharply this year and returned to pre-Covid levels in October. 
Growth in investment in the services industry outpaced the
figure for manufacturing, but persistent inflation could
discourage those companies from investing in coming periods as
households pare spending. 
“I don’t think we will see service companies increase
capital investment much without a jump in consumer spending,”
said Minami. “Wage hikes are happening, but they’ve yet to
support consumption.”
Minami expects the results to give a small boost to revised
GDP, while the data will still show the economy contracted in
the third quarter.

Government’s Stimulus Case
Gains in exports have been limited to single-digits during
most parts of this year as demand has cooled in Japan’s key
trading partners, especially China. Imports of raw materials
have been growing at a much slower pace this year and overall
imports are falling partly because of limited demand at home.
The government passed an extra budget to fund a fresh
stimulus package for the economy earlier in the week, and the
BOJ is expected to maintain its main policy framework including
negative interest rates when its board meets later this month.
