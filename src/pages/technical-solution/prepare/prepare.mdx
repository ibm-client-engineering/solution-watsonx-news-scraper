1. Download and install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


2. Ensure that you have the following Python packages installed:
    * pandas
    * requests
    * bs4
    * json
    * re
    * dateutil
    * ibm-watson-machine-learning


3. Create an IBM cloud account and sign up for watson<span style="color:blue">x</span>. You can sign up for a free trail for watson<span style="color:blue">x</span>.ai [here](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/info/trial).


4. Select free news sites that you would like to scrape. While subscription-based news services such as Bloomberg are also possible to scrape, the task becomes much more complicated. In this demo, we will scrape from CNN and CNBC.
