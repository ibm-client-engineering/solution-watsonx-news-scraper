1. Download and install [Python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * You may want to use anaconda and create a separate conda environment for this demo asset. See [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/miniconda-install/) for information on installing miniconda.


2. Ensure that you have the python packages listed in assets/requirements.txt installed.
    * You can run a simple `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all of them at once. See the README in the assets folder for installation tips.


3. Create an IBM cloud account and sign up for watson<span style="color:blue">x</span>. You can sign up for a free trail for watson<span style="color:blue">x</span>.ai [here](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai/info/trial).


4. Select free news sites that you would like to scrape. While subscription-based news services such as Bloomberg are also possible to scrape, the task becomes much more complicated. In this demo, we will scrape from CNN and CNBC.
